# S2CB-WAD-Fitness

### A duo project performed during the second semester of my education.

Part of the class: Web Application Development (WAD). A simple project existing of plain HTML & CSS, PHP (OOD in PHP sucks) and JavaScript.

Seeing the again after 2 years made me realise how much I love JavaScript frameworks.
